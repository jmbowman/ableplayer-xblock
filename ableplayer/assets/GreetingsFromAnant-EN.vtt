ANANT AGARWAL: Welcome to edX.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.530
I am Anant Agarwal.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.210
I am the CEO of edX.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.650
I am also a Professor of Electrical Engineering

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.470
and Computer Science at MIT.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.200
Online learning is revolutionizing the world.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.520
Education will never be the same again, and edX is

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.730
at the cutting edge of this revolution.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.880
So when you take edX courses online, you are part of this revolution.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.650
Online learning is the ultimate democratizer.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.290
When you learn on edX, you are joining a community.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.610
Imagine taking a class with 100,000 or more students.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.549
This is social.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.610
This is a lot of fun.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.210
I think you&#39;ll enjoy the experience.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.387
edX is about the best courses, from the best schools, and the best professors.

00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:40.720
PROFESSOR: Courses can be tough.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.900
We make sure that they&#39;re rigorous, but they can also be a lot of fun.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.040
The courseware is made up of great videos, automated feedback,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.250
and cool interactive features all for self-paced learning.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.650
Interactives are designed to help you explore

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.030
your understanding of key concepts.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.400
A big part of at edX is the social aspect.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.180
You can be as social as you want on the discussion boards.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.540
There&#39;s an active community.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.459
It&#39;s not just the professors, students help each other out.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.080
Once you&#39;ve completed the course, you&#39;re part of our group of lifelong learners.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.480
ANANT AGARWAL: And edX&#39;s mission is to help you get a quality education.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.150
